            Hey, today is Valentine‚Äôs Day, and this song will express my feelings for you. Do you remember when we met in our class? We were strangers to each other. But sometime later, in 2021, I started to have a crush on you. Today, after almost four years, my feelings for you are still the same. This book will tell you all about my love for you

            I know it will take a lot of time to settle everything. We both understand that now is our time to focus on our careers.
            But still, we can try to balance it with our relationship. Today is the first Valentine‚Äôs Day that I am going to celebrate with someone.
            I just wanted to let you know how much I appreciate you, how much I
            admire you, and how thankful I am to have you in my life.
