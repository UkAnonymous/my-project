            Hey, today is Valentine’s Day, and this song will express my feelings for you. Do you remember when we met in our class? We were strangers to each other. But sometime later, in 2021, I started to have a crush on you. Today, after almost four years, my feelings for you are still the same. This book will tell you all about my love for you
